This project is a **Car Price Prediction Application** that estimates the resale value of a car based on various features such as the car's company, model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes a machine learning model to provide precise estimations of car resale values.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive web application for seamless user experience.
- **Comprehensive Input Options**: Allows users to input multiple car attributes for a tailored prediction.

## Input Fields

- **Car Company**: Select the manufacturer of the car.
- **Model**: Choose the specific model of the car.
- **Year of Purchase**: Enter the year the car was purchased.
- **Fuel Type**: Select the type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).
- **Kilometers Driven**: Input the total kilometers the car has been driven.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing various car features and their corresponding resale prices. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed for optimal performance.

---

## Model

A Linear Regression model is used to predict the car prices. The model has been trained and saved as  
`linear-regression_model.pkl` for inference.

## Deployment
This application is deployed on Render.
